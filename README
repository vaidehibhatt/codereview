Imagine This Code as a Door Lock System
Think of the code like a door to a secret room. You want to make sure only the right people can get in, right?
But if the lock is weak, anyone can break in.

Think of It Like This:
MD5 = Old, easy-to-pick lock

Hardcoded passwords = Leaving your keys under the mat 

No rate limiting = No security guard to stop bad guys 

Debug mode on = Open door with people inside 

No input validation = Letting anyone walk into your house without checking ID 

Secure Version of the Flask Login API
We'll fix the following:

Use bcrypt for secure password hashing.

Store user data in a database instead of hardcoding.

Add rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

Disable debug mode for security.

Validate inputs to ensure safe data.
